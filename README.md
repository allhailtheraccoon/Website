# Website
It's for a Wobsite :P
So, like, I'mma try'n 2 mac ayy wobsite and uh, this is, uh the description of that website:

Imagine your wildest dreams! Now stop imagining that, we don't do that here... instead we (my orginization and I that is) focus on spreading whimsy to the furthest corners of the globe, unfortunately globes don't have corners because they're like anti-prolate spheroids, I mean... unless they're tidally locked in which case they wouldn't have an equatorial buulllgge and therefor they wouldn't have corners because they're spheroids er sferes nothing oid about them... where were we (my organization and I that is... as stated)? Oh yeah, WhImSeY, we'll have it. (probably going to use a mix of HTML and p5.js)
